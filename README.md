### Definitions

- The popup is displayed once a visitor has been on the website for 3 seconds.

- Once the popup is closed, it is not deployed on any subsequent reloads/pageviews. It is controlled using localStorage.

- The layout is responsive and looks good on all breakpoints from 320px to 1200px. It was also developed using the mobile-first approach.

- The two visual elements on the page are animated using [Rellax.js](https://dixonandmoe.com/rellax/ "Rellax.js"); the first goes up very slowly when the visitor scrolls down, and the second goes down a little bit faster.

- AODA/WCAG Compliant. The page is accessible and navigable via keyboard, and it is possible to close the popup by navigating to the Close button or pressing Esc.
